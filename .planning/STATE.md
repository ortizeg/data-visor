# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** A single tool that replaces scattered scripts: load any CV dataset, visually browse with annotation overlays, compare GT vs predictions, cluster via embeddings, and surface mistakes -- all in one workflow.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Data Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 4 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-10 -- Roadmap created with 7 phases, 26 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phases 4 (Predictions) and 5 (Embeddings) are independent and can execute in parallel
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 (Intelligence) flagged for deeper research during planning (Pydantic AI tool design, VLM calibration)
- [Roadmap]: GRID-03 (GT vs Predictions toggle) assigned to Phase 4 rather than Phase 2 because it requires predictions to exist

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5: SigLIP 2 vs DINOv2 decision requires benchmark spike during embedding implementation
- Phase 7: Pydantic AI tool design and VLM prompt engineering are less documented -- use research-phase before planning
